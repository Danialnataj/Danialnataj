### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Danial!

- I am a former student of Gothenburg University where I recieved my bachelors in economics.
- I have since found my interest in programming and have begun to venture into the world of tech.
- I have recently finished my courses in Java, and am now on my way to learn python independently.
- My plans for the fall is to study computer engineering and make a career change into the world of tech.
- I will post different types of projects from beginner to more advance (to the best of my ability).
